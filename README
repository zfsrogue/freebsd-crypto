Welcome to the unofficial zfs-crypto branch.

To make it clear, this branch has nothing to do with Sun, Oracle,
ZFSOnLinux, OpenSolaris, IllumOS, OpenIndiana, SmartOS, FreeBSD etc.

There are new files,

zcrypt.c
zcrypt.h
zio_crypt.c
zio_crypt.h
dsl_crypto.c
dsl_crypto.h
libzfs_crypto.c
zcrypt_common.c

which are kept "as is" as much as possible, including (possibly
irrelevant) headers.

The crypto/api/ header files are from OpenSolaris.

The crypto/api implementation is brand new, and supports "bare
minimum" features as needed by ZFS only.

* Removed KEY methods "https URI" (requires curl) and pkcs11 types.

* The pool version is now 5000, and added feature flag
  "feature@encryption".

* feature@encryption goes active if any ZFS are created with encryption=on.

* Allow for readonly import of active feature@encryption, so that the non-
  encrypted filesystems could be recovered.
